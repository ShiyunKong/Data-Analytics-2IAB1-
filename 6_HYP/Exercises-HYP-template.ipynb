    "- The first part introduces the concepts for this week. The theory is interleaved with small exercises, which have the goal of letting you practice the concepts that were just intruduced.\n",

    "All exercises can be solved with the concepts that were introduced earlier. Since there are often more than one correct way to solve a programming problem, we try to accept various correct anwers. However, many of the automatic tests in Momotor (see _How to submit your work_ below) assume that your answers are constructed using the concepts introduced in these notebooks. If you look for answers on the Internet (e.g. if you import other libraries) you run the risk that your answers will be rejected.\n",

    "Some of the small exercises can be solved by copy-pasting code from the examples. However, it is up to you to try to solve the exercises yourself, which will help you learn, before copy-pasting the answers. The ease of looking up answers is meant to provide guidance when you get stuck, especially for those of you who are new to programming.\n",

    "\n",
    "The following concepts are involved in a statistical hypothesis test:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. **Null hypothesis $H_0$**\n",
    "    (the \"there-is-nothing-special-to-this-and-it-is-all-just-coincidence\" assumption) and\n",
    "    **alternative hypothesis $H_a$** (the \"there-is-something-special-to-this\" assumption).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Level of significance**, also known as $\\alpha$-value.\n",
    "    It is the probability of a _Type-I error_ that one is willing to accept,\n",
    "    that is, the probability that the null hypothesis will be rejected while it is actually true.\n",
    "    Typically $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test statistic**:\n",
    "    a value calculated from the observed data according to a standardized formula,\n",
    "    which is used in the hypothesis test (function) to either reject or fail to reject $H_0$.\n",
    "    It depends on the type of test being applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **p-value** (probability of the observed data under the assumption of the null hypothesis)\n",
    "    and/or **confidence interval**\n",
    "    (an interval estimated from the observed data that contains the actual value with a given\n",
    "    probability, the level of confidence, which is typically $1 - \\alpha$).\n",
    "    \n",
    "The decision rule is as follows:\n",
    "if, under the assumption that the null hypothesis holds, the probability of the observed data\n",
    "is less than $\\alpha$,\n",
    "then the null hypothesis is _rejected_;\n",
    "that is, the observed data is considered statistically significant ('special')\n",
    "under the null hypothesis;\n",
    "that is, the observed data is not likely to be explained by coincidence under the null hypothesis.\n",

We are either interested in the **equality of means** or in the **equality of proportions**. It is important to consciously choose between the two.\n",

If the dataset is small *and* not normally distributed, the test would not be valid. Therefore, before performing the test we should verify that this assumption holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a rule of thumb in these exercises, a dataset is considered small if it contains fewer than 50 samples. In general, deciding if a dataset should be considered small is complicated, and outside the scope of this course.\n",

    "* a **kernel density plot** (which we already encountered in the EDA exercises);\n",
