    "This notebook has the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first part introduces the concepts for this week. The theory is interleaved with small exercises, which have the goal of letting you practice the concepts that were just intruduced.\n",
    "- At the end there are one or more larger exercises, which have the goal to test what you have learned earlier. These will be more difficult and will require more independent work than the exercises in the first part.\n",
    "\n",
    "All exercises can be solved with the concepts that were introduced earlier. Since there are often more than one correct way to solve a programming problem, we try to accept various correct anwers. However, many of the automatic tests in Momotor (see _How to submit your work_ below) assume that your answers are constructed using the concepts introduced in these notebooks. If you look for answers on the Internet (e.g. if you import other libraries) you run the risk that your answers will be rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the small exercises can be solved by copy-pasting code from the examples. However, it is up to you to try to solve the exercises yourself, which will help you learn, before copy-pasting the answers. The ease of looking up answers is meant to provide guidance when you get stuck, especially for those of you who are new to programming.\n",

    "\n",
    "So far, we have dealt with data contained in a _single table_,\n",
    "typically stored in a CSV file and operated on in a Pandas `DataFrame`.\n",
    "Often, however, the use of a single table leads to unnecessary duplication of data\n",
    "and difficulties in data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "consider an experiment where we collect data from various patients.\n",
    "We have data pertaining to each patient:\n",
    "name, date of birth, and daily weight and temperature measurements.\n",
    "How to _organize_ that data and store it?\n",
    "This is important for the _data collection_ process and subsequent\n",
    "_data analysis_ process.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could try to put it in one table,\n",
    "with one row per patient, and columns for name, date of birth, and each (day, measurement)-pair:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Name | Date of Birth | Day 1 Weight | Day 1 Temperature | Day 2 Weight | Day 2 Temperature | ... |\n",
    "| :--- | :------------ | -----------: | ----------------: | -----------: | ----------------: | --: |\n",
    "| A | 1950-01-01 | 60.0 | 37.8 | 59.8 | 38.1 | ... |\n",

    "| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of columns would grow, and could differ per patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could try to put it in one table,\n",
    "with one row per patient per day,\n",
    "and columns for name, date of birth, day, weight, and temperature,\n",
    "repeating values that stay the same (name and date of birth):\n",

    "| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n",

    "| 72 |  2 | 84.3 | 39.2 |\n",
    "| ... | ... | ... | ... |\n",
    "\n",
    "The additional column `ID` relates the two tables,\n",
    "and helps to keep apart patients with the same name and date of birth.\n",
    "It functions as the *key* of these two tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that you have a basic understanding of how a _relational database_ is organized:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a collection of (named, related) *tables*, where\n",
    "* each table consists of a collection of *rows*, where\n",
    "* each row contains one _value_ per *column*,\n",
    "* where all values in a column belong to a prescribed *type*.\n",
